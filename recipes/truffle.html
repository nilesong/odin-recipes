    <h1>Chocolate Truffle Cookies</h1>
    <img src="../img/truffle.jpeg" alt="truffle">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A very dark, rich chocolate cookie for the true chocoholic. This recipe uses relatively little flour, resulting
        in dense, fudge-like cookies. These cookies keep well in the freezer (but you may have a hard time waiting for
        them to thaw before you eat them). </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In the microwave or in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water, melt unsweetened chocolate, 1 cup of the
            chocolate chips, and the butter stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
            In a large bowl, whip eggs and sugar until thick and pale, about 2 minutes. Stir in the vanilla and the
            chocolate mixture until well mixed. Combine the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt; gradually stir into
            the chocolate mixture. Fold in remaining 1 cup chocolate chips. Cover dough and chill for at least an hour
            or overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll chilled dough into 1 inch balls. Place on ungreased
            cookie sheets so they are 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake for 9 to 11 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before
            removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
